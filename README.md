American Football League player data analysis, creation of a new metric
In this work, I examined the impact of a new metric I created, body mass index, on the playing characteristics of American Football League players. There are some binary indicators that react differently to the game behavior of different players. With the help of statistical theories, I tried to show that the metric I created has an impact on these indicators.
